        <h2>Houston Dragon Academy Counselor</h2>
        <p>
          I served as a camp counselor at Houston Dragon Academy, where I worked
          closely with students in both academic and recreational settings. My role
          involved supporting students’ learning in subjects such as English and
          Math while helping create a structured, welcoming environment that
          encouraged participation and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also assisted with day-to-day camp operations, including preparing
          classrooms and organizing materials, ensuring activities ran smoothly
          and students remained engaged throughout the program.

        <h2>Peer Teacher for ENGR 102</h2>
        <p>
          As an ENGR 102 Peer Teacher, I assisted professors and lab instructors in
          supporting over 700 undergraduate engineering students in an
          introductory Python course. I guided students through hands-on
          programming exercises during weekly lab sessions, explained core
          concepts, and provided real-time feedback to help strengthen their
          problem-solving and debugging skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical instruction, I mentored first-year engineering students
          by providing ETAM guidance, helping them navigate their first semester,
          and advising on course selection and academic planning. This role
          strengthened my communication and leadership skills and allowed me to
          support students both academically and personally during their
          transition into engineering at Texas A&M.
