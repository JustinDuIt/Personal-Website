    <h1>Houston Dragon Academy Counselor</h1>
    
    <h3>I served as a camp counselor at Houston Dragon Academy, where I worked closely with students in both academic and recreational settings. My role involved supporting students’ learning in subjects such as English and Math while helping create a structured, welcoming environment that encouraged participation and growth. I also assisted with day-to-day camp operations, including preparing classrooms and organizing materials, which helped ensure that activities ran smoothly and students remained engaged throughout the program.</h3>    
    
    <h1>Peer Teacher for ENGR 102</h1>

    <h3>As an ENGR 102 Peer Teacher, I assisted professors and lab instructors in supporting over 700 undergraduate engineering students in the introductory Python course. I worked closely with students during weekly lab sessions, guiding them through hands-on programming exercises, explaining core concepts, and providing real-time feedback to help them build strong problem-solving, debugging, and coding skills. In addition to technical instruction, I mentored first-year engineering students by providing ETAM guidance, helping them navigate their first semester, and advising on course selection and academic planning. Through this role, I developed strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills, and found it especially rewarding to support students both in their technical growth and their transition into engineering at Texas A&M.    </h3>
