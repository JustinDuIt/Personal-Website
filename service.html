    <h1>Research Asssitant at SETH Lab</h1>
    
    <h3>During my time at Texas A&M, I worked as a research assistant in the SETH (Secure and Trustworthy Hardware) Lab, where I contributed to research focused on improving the security and reliability of modern computing systems. I worked under the guidance of a PhD student on a project exploring zero-knowledge proofs, a method that allows a system to prove that a computation was performed correctly without revealing the internal details of how it was executed.</h3>
    <h3>The goal of this research was to make it possible to verify complex computations, such as those used in machine learning, even when they are run on hardware that may not be fully trusted. Rather than assuming the system performing the computation is secure, the approach checks correctness with very high confidence while minimizing the amount of work required by the verifier. This makes the system both secure and efficient in practical settings.</h3>
    <h3>My role involved expanding the project’s capabilities and improving its overall structure. I helped add support for additional types of operations and reorganized the software so that different parts of the process could run independently. This separation allows computationally intensive tasks to be handled by powerful machines, while simpler verification steps can be performed on smaller, low-cost devices.</h3>
    <h3>Overall, my experience in the SETH Lab strengthened my understanding of system security at a high level and showed me how research ideas can be translated into practical tools. It also helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and experience working collaboratively on technically challenging projects with real-world impact.</h3>
    
    
    <h1>Peer Teacher for ENGR 102</h1>
    
    
    <h3>As an ENGR 102 Peer Teacher, I assist professors and lab instructors in leading the Intro to Python course for over 700 undergraduate engineering students. My role focuses on helping students build foundational programming skills, including problem-solving, debugging, and writing clean, efficient code.</h3>
    <h3>During weekly lab sessions, I guide students through hands-on exercises, explain core programming concepts, and provide real-time feedback to reinforce learning. I also help students apply theoretical concepts to practical coding projects, ensuring they develop confidence and a strong understanding of programming best practices.</h3>
    <h3>Beyond technical instruction, I support first-year engineering students by sharing ETAM advice, guiding them on how to navigate their first semester, and helping them choose appropriate courses. I answer questions about academic planning, offer tips on study strategies, and provide practical advice on adjusting to college life.</h3>
    <h3>Through this role, I have strengthened my communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills. It has been rewarding to help students succeed not only in coding but also in their transition to engineering at Texas A&M, giving them the guidance they need to thrive academically and personally.</h3>
