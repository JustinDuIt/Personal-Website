            <h3>I am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University with experience spanning embedded systems, electronics, hardware security, and software development. I enjoy building systems that bridge hardware and software, whether through low-level system work, backend services, or web-based applications. With a strong interest in learning and problem-solving, I value versatility and adaptability in engineering environments and enjoy contributing to projects that are practical, scalable, and impactful. I am also passionate about mentorship and supporting others as they navigate technical coursework and early career decisions, and I aim to continue growing as an engineer while developing technology that creates meaningful real-world impact.</h3>
